/**
 * This file is a javascript driver for a simple 4 function calculator. The +/= button works as toggle
 * functionality when an operand is already on the screen and + button is pressed, it 
 * subsequently changes to "=" operator. 
 */

/**
 * What is working : 
 * Calculator will work with chaining or operand and opertator but after every operation
 * you need to ensure that the = sign is pressed for the calculation to go ahead in the
 * chaining. For example: a+b=(result via +/= button)-c=(result via +/= button)*d should
 * work and give an output in accordance to order of operations.
 * 
 * What would not work:
 * Literal chaining of operand and operation. For example: a+b-c*d.
