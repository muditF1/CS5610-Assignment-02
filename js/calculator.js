/**
 * This file is a javascript driver for a simple 4 function calculator. The +/= button works as toggle
 * functionality when an operand is already on the screen and + button is pressed, it 
 * subsequently changes to "=" operator. 
 */

/**
 * How/What is working : 
 * 1. Calculator will perform arithmetic operation between operands after pressing the +/= key.
 * 2. You need to ensure that the "+/=" button is pressed to get a result and only then move.
 * 3. For Example : 7 + 1 - 6 * 2 / 2
 *    How this calculate expression would work with this calculator:
 *      Step 01: Press 7
 *      Step 02: Press +/=
 *      Step 03: Press 1
 *      Step 04: Press +/=
 *      Step 05: Press -
 *      Step 06: Press 6
 *      Step 07: Press +/=
 *      Step 08: Press *
 *      Step 09: Press 2
 *      Step 10: Press +/=
 *      Step 11: Press /
 *      Step 12: 2
 *      Step 13: Press +/=
 * 
 * What would not work:
 * Literal chaining of operand and operation like this
 * example: a+b-c*d without pressing an equals sign would not work.
